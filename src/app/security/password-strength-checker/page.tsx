                    Why Password Strength Matters
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Strong passwords are your first line of defense against
                    unauthorized access to your accounts. With data breaches
                    becoming increasingly common, having a strong, unique
                    password for each account is more important than ever.

                    What Makes a Strong Password?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A strong password should be long (at least 12 characters),
                    complex (using a mix of character types), unpredictable
                    (avoiding common words or patterns), and unique (not used
                    for multiple accounts).

                    How Our Password Strength Checker Works
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Our tool analyzes multiple factors including length,
                    character variety, common patterns, and predictability. We
                    calculate entropy (randomness) and estimate how long it
                    would take different types of attacks to crack your
                    password.

                    Note: This tool performs all analysis locally in your
                    browser. Your password is never sent to our servers or
                    stored anywhere.
